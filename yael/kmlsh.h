 * K-means LSH is an implementation of the technique described in the following paper
 * "Locality sensitive hashing: a comparison of hash function types and querying mechanisms",
 * by L. Pauleve, H. Jegou and L. Amsaleg, Pattern Recognition Letters, August 2010
 * 
 * Only the regular LSH (multiple hash functions, no multi-probe, no query adaptive)
 * is provided. This implementation is not intended for a classical query/database 
 * scenario, although it could be used for (with relatively low efficienty). 
 * Instead, it is optimized towards batch processing of large amounts of queries.
