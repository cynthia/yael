Getting Started
===============


Getting SVN version and content
-------------------------------

Retrieve the last archive file on the gforge INRIA web server. 
Windows users should probably use an older version, as we do not support Windows (existing 
versions are external contributions which are not maintained). 


You may be interested in the last in obtaining the latest version of Yael. 
For registered users, it can be retrieved from the SVN as follows::

  svn checkout svn+ssh://mygforgelogin@scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/yael/trunk yael

This performs the installation of the regular Yael branch of the project into the directory Yael. 
This installation directory is referred to as YAELROOT in the following. 
There is also an anonymous access, which is provided by using one of the following commands::

  svn checkout --username anonsvn https://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/yael


The password for anonymous login is 'anonsvn'. 

The library is organized as follows::

  YAELROOT/                root directory 
  YAELROOT/LICENCE         licensing information 
  YAELROOT/Makefile        generic Makefile 
  YAELROOT/makefile.inc    configuration file generated by `onfigure.sh
  YAELROOT/configure.sh    configuration program with basic auto-detection procedures.  
  YAELROOT/README          subset of this getting started manual 
  YAELROOT/doc/            documentation: getting started and reference manuals 
  YAELROOT/matlab/         matlab interface 
  YAELROOT/progs/          executable programs: front-end and utilities
  YAELROOT/test/           sample test programs for various functions
  YAELROOT/yael/           core yael directory 


Pre-requisites
--------------

The library requires the following software/libraries to be installed. 
Some of them are related to the non-core interfaces (python and matlab) 
and are not strictly mandatory. 

**Blas and Lapack.** 
  Any implementation should work as it is wrapped with the Fortran
  calling conventions.  It might be required to adjust the location of
  these libraries in the ``makefile.inc`` file generated by the
  ``configure.sh`` script.  The ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` environment variable
  may also need to be set accordingly.

**Python-dev.** 
  This package contains the include files of the Python-C API.  Note
  that having python installed on your machine does not necessarily mean
  that the development kit is installed as well.  If only python is
  installed, not python-dev, you will get an error saying that the file
  ``Python.h`` can not be found.

**swig** 
  is required to create the python interface. 

**Matlab** 
  is required only for the matlab Yael interface. 
  It is not compiled by default. 

**doxygen** 
  is used to generate the reference manual (HTML) from the source files. 

**sphinx** and **pdflatex** are used to re-generate this getting started manual. 


These two last pre-requisites are required by the Python interface 
and are not strictly mandatory. If you are not interested by this 
Python interface and that you don't have python-dev and swig installed, 
you should remove the target ``_yael.so`` target in the Makefile of the 
yael core directory. 

Installation procedure
----------------------

The source is compiled with hand-written Makefiles. 
All system-dependent options are defined in the toplevel ``makefile.inc``. 
The makefiles can be called in their directory.


First execute::

./configure.sh

in the yael root directory. This  generates 
the file ``makefile.inc`` using basic auto-detection procedures. 
For most configurations, these should be sufficient. However you might need 
to adjust the variables defined in ``makefile.inc`` to fit your local configuration. 


The standard make tool is used to compile the library::

  make


If everything goes fine, your should be able to compile the programs in progs and test. 


At this point, only the core C and python library are compiled. 
If you need the Matlab interface, you have to compile the mex files [#]_ ::

  cd matlab
  make




In order to generate the reference manual and this tutorial, you should go into the 
doc subdirectory and execute the following command line:: 

  cd doc
  make


**Remark:** In order to use the 32 bit mode on MacOS (not recommanded), 
use the special flag ``--mac32``::

  ./configure.sh --mac32


.. [#] The mex executable should be in the PATH. 
   This is a typical error. Another one occurs when the ``mex`` 
   utility of Octave has a higher priority than 
   the Matlab command with the same name.
